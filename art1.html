        <p>Most people these days use one or more streaming services, and chances are you are no different. It is important to note that keeping on top of security of 
            these services is all too often neglected. It is easy to think that streaming services have no relevance to cybersecurity, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. 
            They are personal services that have financial information tied to them, so keeping them secure is of the utmost importance. In order to keep it secure make your accounts 
            as “personal” as possible. Avoid sharing your account with as many people as possible. The less people that have access to your account, the less likely that one of them 
            will misuse it. It is important that you monitor your streaming activity. Most streaming services offer the ability to track where your account is being accessed from. 
            These features will usually tell you the time of access, what device was used to access it, and the IP address of the device used to access it. 
            If any of this information looks suspicious to you it might be in your best interest to change your account password. Doing so will sign your account out on all 
            your devices and require entering the new password in order to regain functionality.</p>
