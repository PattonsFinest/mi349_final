        <p>There are many different advanced tasks you can do to keep your online data secure. While these are certainly helpful there are a few, more basic things, 
            you can perform. Firstly, keep your software up to date. The older the software that you are using, the more time hackers have had to try and crack it. 
            Keeping things updated helps to remove critical vulnerabilities that can be used to access your device. Using two-factor or multi-factor authentication. 
            These solutions make it so you have to input a unique perishable code, usually sent via text or email, in order to access an account. In the event of a 
            leaked password, this helps keep important information away from intruders. It is a smart idea to avoid using public wifi if possible. Public wifi isn’t 
            well secured and easy for hackers to manipulate. If you do use public wifi, we recommend using a Virtual Private network or VPN. A VPN encrypts the data 
            sent to and from a device connected to the internet. If security is imperative and you can’t use a VPN, we recommend using your cellular network instead of wifi.</p>
