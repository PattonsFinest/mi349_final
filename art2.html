            How to Make A Good Password

        <p class="art-text">Like many other aspects of cyber security, knowing how to make a password is a learnable skill. While the process of making a password is usually straightforward. 
            Making a GOOD password has a little bit of nuance to it. Consider a simple password like, for instance, “password”. While this is easy to remember it is also very 
            easy to guess. How about a sequence of numbers like “12345”. This is the type of combination an idiot would have on his luggage (laugh if you got the reference). 
            In fact, most sequences of same case letters or numbers are relatively easy to acquire, no matter how long. The best way to make a secure password is to use a 
            combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Making a completely random sequence of these will be pretty secure, but also hard to remember. 
            It would be a good idea to make your password a memorable phrase that you jumble the characters up. Just make sure that this phrase has no personal connection 
            (ie. address, names, ect.) or else it will become easier to crack despite your efforts.</p>
